# Mine_Game_Server
A Socket.IO-based server designed to simulate Mine-style gambling game mechanics. Developed in Node.js, this project applies the architectural principles and best practices acquired during my postgraduate studies in Systems Analysis and Development, emphasizing clean structure, modularity, and maintainable code.
